|Date|Hours Spent|Progress Made|
|--|--|--|
|11/22|2.5|Started learning raylib, implemented Grid class (including drawing and storing pixels in it), implemented Vector2i for convenience, implemented a basic Tetrimino class to store the various variants|
|11/26|1.75|Implemented drawing and movement of tetriminoes, including collision and falling|
|11/27|1.25|Implemented the blocks hitting the bottom and a new one spawning, made it speed up over time, made complete lines delete and move the map down. First fully functional prototype. Still buggy.|
|11/30|3.25|Made blocks have their correct colors (no longer random), added score counter, made Tetrimino selection feel more random, made falling curve be based off of score rather than time, allowed holding L/R to keep moving the piece, fixed the line piece going out of bounds on some rotations, (probably) fixed the bug where the tetrimino fills the screen upwards, displayed the score, displayed the next tetrimino, made an end screen that allows for closing the game or starting a new one|
|12/1|.5 12:00|Playtested, improved docstrings|
