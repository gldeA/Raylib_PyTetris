|11/22|2.5|Started learning raylib, implemented Grid class (including drawing and storing pixels in it), implemented Vector2i for convenience, implemented a basic Tetrimino class to store the various variants|
|11/26|1.75|Implemented drawing and movement of tetriminoes, including collision and falling|
|11/27|1.25|Implemented the blocks hitting the bottom and a new one spawning, made it speed up over time, made complete lines delete and move the map down. First fully functional prototype. Still buggy.|
